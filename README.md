Superstore Sales Analysis

This project analyzes a fictional Superstore dataset to explore sales and profit trends using Python. It focuses on identifying patterns by category, region, and product over time.

What this project does:
- Shows total sales by product category
- Plots monthly sales trends
- Highlights top 10 best-selling products
- Analyzes profit by region
- Calculates total and average profit

Tools used:
- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

How to run:
1. Make sure Python is installed
2. Install libraries: pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
3. Run the script: python superstore_sales_analysis.py

Outputs:
- Cleaned dataset saved as cleaned_superstore.csv
- Visuals saved as PNG files
- Summary of sales and profit printed in the console

This project helped me practice real-world data analysis, EDA, and storytelling through charts and business metrics.
